        "The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.
         It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife,
         Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. "</div>

        "The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being
        "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
        It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history."</div>

        "Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643,
         but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex
         is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time
         to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $1 billion).
         The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects
         led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri."</div>
