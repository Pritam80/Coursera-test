  in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who
  comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does
  actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself
  in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the
  worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
  cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."</div>
