        <div id="main-text-1">
          Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world,
          and was one of the first domesticated animals.
          Chicken is a major worldwide source of meat and eggs for
          human consumption. It is prepared as food in a wide
          variety of ways, varying by region and culture. The
          prevalence of chickens is due to almost the entire chicken
          being edible, and the ease of raising them.
          Chicken as a meat has been depicted in Babylonian carvings from around 600 BC.
          Chicken was one of the most common meats available in
          the Middle Ages.[citation needed] It was eaten over
          most of the Eastern hemisphere and a number of different kinds of
          chicken such as capons, pullets and hens were eaten.
          It was one of the basic ingredients in the so-called
          white dish, a stew usually consisting of chicken and
          fried onions cooked in milk and seasoned with spices and sugar.<br>

          Beef is the culinary name for meat from bovines, especially cattle.
          Beef can be harvested from cows, bulls, heifers or steers.
          Acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of the world.
          Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world,
          accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork
          and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.In absolute numbers,
          the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's
          three largest consumers of beef. On a per capita basis in 2009,
          Argentines consumed the most beef at 64.6 kg per person; people in
          the U.S. ate 40.2 kg, while those in the E.U. ate 16.9 kg.<br>

        <span>Sushi</span>
        <div id="main-text-3">
          Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a traditional Japanese
          dish of prepared vinegared rice (sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt,
          accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and
          vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the
          one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.
          Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it
          can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very
          often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna
          or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian.
          It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce.
          Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
          Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese
          cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat.<br>
          The common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared
          sushi rice. Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.
          Due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is pronounced
          with zu instead of su when a prefix is attached, as in nigirizushi.<br>
          The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in
          variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan.
          A notable exception to this is the use of salmon. Historically,
          the Japanese have eaten salmon since prehistory; however, caught salmon
          in nature often contains parasites and must be cooked or cured for its
          lean meat to be edible - therefore, unsuitable as raw meat. On the
          other side of the world, in the 1960s and 1970s, Norwegian entrepreneurs
          started experimenting with aquaculture farming. The big breakthrough
          was when they figured out how to raise salmon in net pens in the sea.
